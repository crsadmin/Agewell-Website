          <p>
            We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us

            and the Website, the choices you make and the products and features
            you use. The personal information we collect may include the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Personal Information provided by you:</strong> We collect
              names; phone numbers; email addresses, contact preferences;
              contact or authentication data; billing addresses; debit/credit

              <strong>Payment Data.</strong> EduFIT uses Stripe as our payment
              platform. We may collect data necessary to process your payment if

              your payment instrument. All payment data is stored by

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All personal information that you provide to us must be true,

          <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
          <p>
            <strong
              >In Short: Some information such as your Internet Protocol (IP)
              address and/or browser and device characteristics is collected
              automatically when you visit our Website.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or
            navigate the Website. This information does not reveal your specific
            identity (like your name or contact information) but may include
            device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and
            device characteristics, operating system, language preferences,
            referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about
            who and when you use our Website and other technical information.
            This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and
            operation of our Website, and for our internal analytics and
            reporting purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies
            and similar technologies. The information we collect includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Device Data.</strong> We collect device data such as
              information about your computer, phone, tablet or other device you
              use to access the Website. Depending on the device used, this
              device data may include information such as your IP address (or
              proxy server), device application identification numbers,
              location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider
              and/or mobile carrier, operating system configuration information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Location Data.</strong> We collect information data such
              as information about your device’s location, which can be either
              precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on
              the type of settings of the device you use to access the Website.
              For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect
              geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on
              your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this
              information either by refusing access to the information or by
              disabling your location settings on your device. Note however, if
              you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects
              of the Services.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Information collected from other sources</h3>

              marketing partners, and other outside sources.</strong
            >
          </p>

            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your

            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from

            modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect

          <h2>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you
            can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online Browse activities monitored and collected. At this
            stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this privacy notice.
