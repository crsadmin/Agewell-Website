          </p>

          <h2>Account registration</h2>
          <p>
            To use ‘EduFIT at Home’ or ‘MenoWell at Home’, you must register or
            create a User account, providing all required data or information in
            a complete and truthful manner. Failure to do so will result in
            unavailability of the Service. Users are responsible for keeping
            their login credentials confidential and safe. For this reason,
            Users are also required to choose passwords that meet the highest
            standards of strength permitted by EduFIT.
          </p>

          <p>
            By registering, Users agree to be fully responsible for all
            activities that occur under their username and password. Users are
            required to immediately inform EduFIT via the contact details
            indicated in this document, if they think their personal
            information, including but not limited to User accounts, access
            credentials or personal data, have been violated, unduly disclosed,
            or stolen. Unless explicitly permitted, a User account may not be
            shared with other persons.
          </p>

          <h2>Account suspension and deletion</h2>
          <p>
            EduFIT reserves the right to suspend or delete a User account at any
            time and without notice if we deem the account inappropriate,
            offensive or in violation of these Terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            The suspension or deletion of User accounts shall not entitle Users
            to any claims for compensation, damages, or reimbursement.
          </p>

          <p>
            The suspension or deletion of accounts due to causes attributable to
            the User does not exempt the User from paying any applicable fees or
            prices.
          </p>

          <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
          <h3>Automatic renewal</h3>
          <p>
            ‘EduFIT at Home’ and ‘MenoWell at Home’ subscriptions begin on the
            day the payment is received by EduFIT. EduFIT uses automatic renewal
            for subscriptions. Subscriptions are automatically renewed through
            the payment method that the User chose during purchase, unless the
            User cancels the subscription within the deadlines for termination
            specified in the relevant section of these Terms. The renewed
            subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.
          </p>

          <h3>Termination</h3>
          <p>
            Recurring subscriptions may be terminated at any time by sending a
            clear and unambiguous termination notice to EduFIT using the email
            address using the following contact details
            <a href="mailto:info@edufit.ie">info@edufit.ie</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>Termination notice</h3>
          <p>
            If the notice of termination is received by EduFIT before the
            subscription renews, the termination shall take effect as soon as
            the current period (one month) is completed.
          </p>

          <h2>EduFIT Content Rights</h2>
          <p>
            EduFIT reserves all content rights. Users may not copy, download,
            share (beyond the limits set forth below), modify, translate,
            transform, publish, transmit, sell, sublicense, edit,
            transfer/assign to third parties or create derivative works from the
            content available on EduFIT, nor allow any third party to do so
            through the User or their device, even without the User’s knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where explicitly stated on EduFIT, the User may download, copy
            and/or share some content available through EduFIT for its sole
            personal and non-commercial use and provided that the copyright
            attributions and all the other attributions requested by the Owner
            are correctly implemented.
          </p>

          <h2>Offers and Discounts</h2>
          <p>
            EduFIT may offer discounts or special offers for the purchase of
            products or services. Any such offer or discount shall always be
            subject to the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set
            out. Offers and discounts are always granted at EduFIT’s sole
            discretion. Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no
            claim/title or right that Users may enforce in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            Discounts or offers will be valid for a limited time only or while
            stocks last. If an offer or discount is limited by time, the time
            indications refer to EduFIT’s (Ireland) time zone unless otherwise
            specified.
          </p>

          <h2>Return Policy</h2>
          <p><strong>All sales are final.</strong></p>

          <h2>Indemnity</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless EduFIT, its
            directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, and affiliates,
            from any and all third-party claims, liability, damages and/or costs
            (including, but not limited to, legal fees) arising from your use of
            this Website of your breach of these Terms of Service.
          </p>

          <h2>Invalidity</h2>
          <p>
            If any part of the Terms of Service is unenforceable (including any
            provision in which we exclude our liability to you), the
            enforceability of any other part of the Terms of Service will not be
            affected by all other clauses remaining in full force and effect. So
            far as possible where any clause/sub-clause or part of a
            clause/sub-clause can be severed to render the remaining part valid,
            the clause shall be interpreted accordingly. Alternatively, you
            agree that the clause shall be rectified and interpreted in such a
            way that closely resembles the original meaning of the
            clause/sub-clause as is permitted by law.
          </p>

          <h2>Complaints</h2>
          <p>
            We operate a complaint handling procedure which we will use to try
            to resolve disputes when they first arise. Please let us know by
            email at <a href="mailto:info@edufit.ie">info@edufit.ie</a> if you
            have any complaints or comments.
          </p>

          <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
          <p>
            The above Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement of the
            parties and supersede any and all preceding and contemporaneous
            agreements between you and
            <a href="www.edufit.ie">www.edufit.ie</a>. Any waiver of any
            provision of the Terms of Service will be effective only if in
            writing and signed by a Director of EduFIT.
          </p>

          <h2>Links To Other Web Sites</h2>
          <p>
            Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services
            that are not owned or controlled by
            <a href="www.edufit.ie">www.edufit.ie</a>. EduFIT has no control
            over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy
            policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services. You
            further acknowledge and agree that EduFIT shall not be responsible
            or liable, directly, or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or
            alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on
            any such content, goods, or services available on or through any
            such web sites or services.
          </p>

          <h2>Service Interruption</h2>
          <p>
            To ensure the best possible service level, EduFIT reserves the right
            to interrupt the Service for maintenance, system updates or any
            other changes, informing the Users appropriately.
          </p>

          <p>
            Within the limits of law, EduFIT may also decide to suspend or
            terminate the Service altogether. If the Service is terminated,
            EduFIT will cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw personal
            data or information in accordance with applicable law. Additionally,
            the Service might not be available due to reasons outside EduFIT’s
            reasonable control, such as “force majeure” (e.g., labor actions,
            infrastructural breakdowns, or blackouts etc).
          </p>

          <p>
            Please note, we do not hold live online exercise classes on Bank
            Holidays in Ireland. EduFIT closes for one week at Christmas. There
            will be no live exercise classes at this time but the on-demand
            library will be available. We will email all ‘EduFIT at Home’ and
            ‘MenoWell at Home’ members at the beginning of December.
          </p>

          <p>
            On a rare occasion, due to an unforeseen circumstance (e.g., injury
            or illness of one of our fitness instructors), we may have to cancel
            a live online exercise class at short notice. However, we will do
            everything possible to avoid this situation and on-demand exercise
            videos are always available.
