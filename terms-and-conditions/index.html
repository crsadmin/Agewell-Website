            operated by EduFIT, Portarlington, Co. Laois, Ireland, on behalf of

            changes we may have made to the Terms of Service. Access to this
            Website is permitted on a temporary basis, and we reserve the right
            to withdraw or amend the Services without notice. We will not be
            liable if for any reason this Website is unavailable at any time or
            for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some
            parts or all of this Website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your access to and use of the services on this website is
            conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
            These Terms apply to all visitors, Users and others
            who access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you
            agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of

          </p>

          <h2>Account registration</h2>
          <p>
            To use ‘AgeWell Europe’, you must register or create a User account,
            providing all required data or information in a complete and
            truthful manner. Failure to do so will result in unavailability of
            the Service. Users are responsible for keeping their login
            credentials confidential and safe. For this reason, Users are also
            required to choose passwords that meet the highest standards of
            strength permitted by AgeWell Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
            By registering, Users agree to be fully responsible for all
            activities that occur under their username and password. Users are
            required to immediately inform AgeWell Europe, through EduFIT via
            the contact details indicated in this document, if they think their
            personal information, including but not limited to User accounts,
            access credentials or personal data, have been violated, unduly
            disclosed, or stolen. Unless explicitly permitted, a User account
            may not be shared with other persons.
          </p>

          <h2>Account suspension and deletion</h2>
          <p>
            AgeWell Europe reserves the right to suspend or delete a User
            account at any time and without notice if we deem the account
            inappropriate, offensive or in violation of these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The suspension or deletion of User accounts shall not entitle Users
            to any claims for compensation, damages, or reimbursement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The suspension or deletion of accounts due to causes attributable to
            the User does not exempt the User from paying any applicable fees or
            prices.
          </p>

          <h2>AgeWell Europe Content Rights</h2>
          <p>
            AgeWell Europe reserves all content rights. Users may not copy,
            download, share (beyond the limits set forth below), modify,
            translate, transform, publish, transmit, sell, sublicense, edit,
            transfer/assign to third parties or create derivative works from the
            content available on AgeWell Europe, nor allow any third party to do
            so through the User or their device, even without the User’s
            knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where explicitly stated on AgeWell Europe, the User may download,
            copy and/or share some content available through AgeWell Europe for
            its sole personal and non-commercial use and provided that the
            copyright attributions and all the other attributions requested by
            the Owner are correctly implemented.
          </p>

          <h2>Indemnity</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless AgeWell Europe, its
            directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, and affiliates,
            from any and all third-party claims, liability, damages and/or costs
            (including, but not limited to, legal fees) arising from your use of
            this Website of your breach of these Terms of Service.
          </p>

          <h2>Invalidity</h2>
          <p>
            If any part of the Terms of Service is unenforceable (including any
            provision in which we exclude our liability to you), the
            enforceability of any other part of the Terms of Service will not be
            affected by all other clauses remaining in full force and effect. So
            far as possible where any clause/sub-clause or part of a
            clause/sub-clause can be severed to render the remaining part valid,
            the clause shall be interpreted accordingly. Alternatively, you
            agree that the clause shall be rectified and interpreted in such a
            way that closely resembles the original meaning of the
            clause/sub-clause as is permitted by law.
          </p>

          <h2>Complaints</h2>
          <p>
            We operate a complaint handling procedure which we will use to try
            to resolve disputes when they first arise. Please let us know by
            email at <a href="mailto:info@edufit.ie">info@edufit.ie</a> if you
            have any complaints or comments.
          </p>

          <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
          <p>
            The above Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement of the
            parties and supersede any and all preceding and contemporaneous
            agreements between you and
            <a href="https://agewelleurope.eu/">https://agewelleurope.eu/</a>.
            Any waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service will be
            effective only if in writing and signed by an AgeWell Europe
            Director.
          </p>

          <h2>Service Interruption</h2>
          <p>
            To ensure the best possible service level, AgeWell Europe reserves
            the right to interrupt the Service for maintenance, system updates
            or any other changes, informing the Users appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the limits of law, AgeWell Europe may also decide to suspend
            or terminate the Service altogether. If the Service is terminated,
            AgeWell Europe will cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw
            personal data or information in accordance with applicable law.
            Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons
            outside AgeWell Europe 's reasonable control, such as “force
            majeure” (e.g., labor actions, infrastructural breakdowns, or
            blackouts etc).
          </p>

          <h2>Service Reselling</h2>
          <p>
            Users may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit
            any portion of AgeWell Europe and of its Service without AgeWell
            Europe’s express prior written permission, granted either directly
            or through a legitimate reselling program.
          </p>

          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            To learn more about the use of their Personal Data, Users may refer
            to the privacy policy on the AgeWell Europe website.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace
            these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to
            provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to any new terms taking
            effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our
            sole discretion.
          </p>

          <h2>Contact Us</h2>
